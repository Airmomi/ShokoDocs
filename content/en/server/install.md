## Is Shoko Server Mandatory?{.page-first-header}

The short answer, **Yes**.

Shoko Server is where all the magic happens. It acts as a central database for every program and plugin under the Shoko suite allowing you to access, maintain and watch your anime collection. This also means that Shoko Server **must be  running** to use any other program or plugin that connect to it. Outside of file importing, Shoko Server is no more resource intensive than other programs you probably have running in the background, so you don't need to worry about Shoko Server eating up resources.

##### Windows

Navigate to the [Shoko Downloads](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/) page and download **Shoko Server**, unless told otherwise we always recommend downloading the **Stable** version. The installer will guide you through the installation process and should only take a couple of minutes. 

Once it's installed, following the instructions on the [First Run Setup](/server/setup) page to configure Shoko Server.

##### Linux - Docker
