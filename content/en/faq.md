Yes it Does!

Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) you can run **Shoko Server** natively on Linux. We've created a [Linux Install Guide](/linux) that we highly recommend all Linux users follow to properly install Shoko Server. If needed, additional support can be found by visiting our **Discord Server**. 

Please keep in mind that Shoko Server on Linux is still in beta so issues are to be expected."
