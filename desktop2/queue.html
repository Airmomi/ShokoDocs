								<p>The <strong>Queue Processor</strong> is a complete replacement for the Queue system currently used by Shoko Server. While the current queue
										system processes queued items in the order they were added, the new system utilizes the users hardware to allow multiple workers to run at
										once reducing wait times. Its important to note that this will not allow Shoko to avoid or work around the rate limiters as doing so could
										lead to the user being banned. However it will allow other queued items to run while waiting to run a queued item that's attached to
										a rate limier. We are planning to allow users to specify how many workers to run at once. within limits as running too many workers at once
										will cause performance issues. In Shoko Desktop 2, the Queue Processor is designed as an overlay so it can be accessed anywhere in the
										program. Clicking outside the panel will automatically close the overlay.</p>

										<p>Some queued tasks are generated by previous queued tasks or require certain tasks items to run before they can. If you pause a queued
												task that generates additional queued tasks, they will not be generated until the queued task is ran. Additionally, if you pause a
												queued task that has is a prerequisite for future queued tasks, they will be paused as well. </p>
