Once its loaded, the filter list will appear offering a variety of default filters as well as any user added ones. If you want to create new filters or edit existing ones, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use Shoko Desktop. Select a filter that&amp;rsquo;s populated, depending on the amount of entries in that filter it might take a few seconds to load.</description></item><item><title>My Anime 3 - Install</title><link>https://docs.shokoanime.com/myanime3/install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.shokoanime.com/myanime3/install/</guid><description>Is Shoko Server Mandatory? The short answer is Yes.
Shoko Server is the back-end of the entire Shoko suite, which means every single program and plugin provided uses it for accessing and maintaining your anime collection. This makes Shoko Server mandatory and also means Shoko Server must be running to use any of the programs or plugins that connect to it. With the exception of file importing, Shoko Server is no more resource intensive than other programs you probably have running in the background so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about Shoko Server eating up resources.</description></item></channel></rss>
