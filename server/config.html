								<p>By default, all tasks related to maintaining and updating your collection are done automatically. By default, every task runs

									fine. However, for various reasons you may need to run one of these tasks manually which is made possible by using an
									<strong>Action</strong>. Most actions are comprised of multiple related tasks with the action name relating to the task or
									tasks it performs.</p>

								<p>While manually running task provides a finer control over your collection, there are a few things to remember. </p>

								<ul>
									<li>Actions are stackable and are added to your queue.</li>
									<li>The time required to finish a task depends on your collection size and the task itself.</li>

						<div class = "row">

							<div class = "col-sm-8">

								<p>Import Folders are the physical locations of where your files are. This means two things, they <strong>must be accessible
									by Shoko Server</strong> and they are <strong>always online</strong>. If using<strong> removable media</strong>, make
									sure its connected before running any <strong>import functions</strong> or <strong>file checking functions</strong> to
									avoid Shoko removing the entries from your collection database.</p>

								<p>There are <strong>two different Import Folder Systems</strong> you can use. The first is <strong>Single Folder</strong>which
									has Shoko add the contents of the folder to your collection. The second is <strong>Drop Source/Destination</strong>which
									has Shoko move files from the <strong>Drop Source</strong> into the <strong>Drop Destination</strong>. You can use both
									of these systems at the same time and/or use them both for the same import folder.</p>

								<p>There are two options available for managing Import Folders.</p>

						<h2 id = "import-time">How Long Will Importing Take?</h2>

						<p>This is no simple answer to this question as the time required to import a file varies based on multiple criteria such as the
							file size, the series it belongs to and the metadata associated with the series. However there is a process every imported file
							goes through which is detailed below.</p>

						<p><strong>1. Hashing The File</strong></p>

						<p>The file is first hashed, the amount of time this takes depends on a couple different factors such as the file size, your CPU and
							the HDD read/write speed that contains the file.</p>

						<p><strong>2. Comparing Hash On AniDB</strong></p>

						<p>Once the file has been hashed, the hash is sent to AniDB for comparison. If the hash is found on AniDB then the file is
							associated with the episode the hash belongs to and the series the episode belongs to is added to your collection. If this is a
							new series, then additional commands are added to the <strong>General Worker</strong> to pull the needed data for the series
							from AniDB.</p>

						<p><strong>3. Downloading Additional Metadata</strong></p>

						<p>If the file belongs to a new series, information related to the series and each episode in the series is downloaded from The
							TvDB. If additional community sites are enabled, such as Trakt.TV then additional commands are added to the <strong>General
								Worker</strong> to update the metadata on your profile on those sites.</p>

						<h2 id = "new-import-folder">Adding A New Import Folder</h2>

						<div class = "row">

							<div class = "col-sm-8">

								<p>Click<strong> New Folder</strong> to add a import folder for your collection.</p>

								<p>A new window will open allowing you to specify the import folder's settings. To make things easier and reduce the chance
									of making a mistake, we recommend clicking the <strong>Folder Icon</strong> to select the location of the import folder.
									If your import folders are external hard drives, network drives or hosted on the cloud, make sure to update their
									locations if they happen to change. Otherwise you'll start to receive errors and depending on the actions you run, the
									entries for those files in your database could be deleted.
								</p>

								<p>Each Import Folder you add has its own setting that can be configured depending on your setup.</p>
