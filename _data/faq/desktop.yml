  - question: What Are Groups?
    link: groups
    answer:
      - Groups allow you to organize and visually stack multiple series, movies, and ova's into one single viewable entry in your collection regardless of where and how the files in that group are organized.
      - A majority of anime have at least one type of related item such as an ova, movie or sequel. Using a group allows the main item and it's related items to be grouped together into one listing reducing multiple entries for the same series. if enabled, Shoko can do all this automatically for you by pulling all related series information from AniDB and creating groups for any anime series and it's related items. You're also able to specify which types of relations you'd like excluded from auto-grouping allowing you to further fine-tune your collection.
  - question: How Does Community Linking Work?
    link: community-links
    answer:
      - During the import process and depending on what <strong>Community Sites</strong> the user has enabled, Shoko will attempt to automatically link a series with these sites. By default, <strong>AniDB</strong> and <strong>The TvDB</strong> are automatically linked as Shoko uses these sites to pull metadata for use in your collection.
      - For more in-depth information, please read the Community Sites section in Shoko Desktop part of the docs.
  - question: My Files Are Being Streamed Instead Of Played Locally!
    link: file-stream
    answer: Shoko will automatically stream your files during playback if the local path for the import folder is incorrect. Navigate to the <strong>Server Tab</strong>, double-click on one of your<strong> Import Folders</strong> and add the local path to the folder. Keep in mind, the local path is the <strong>path to that folder from the computer desktop is on</strong>. For best results and to avoid unforeseen issues, do not used mapped network drives, use the actual network path.
