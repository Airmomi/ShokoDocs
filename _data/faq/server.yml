  - question: After Fresh Install, Shoko Server Will Not Start!
    link: server-start
    answer:
      - Some users have reported being unable to start Shoko Server after a fresh install, usually the issue is related
        to userpermissions in <strong>/ProgramData/ShokoServer</strong> and issues with the <strong>urlacl</strong> not
        being addedproperly. We've created a .BAT file called <strong>FixPermissions.bat</strong> that is located in
        your Shoko Serverinstall directory, close Shoko and run that file.
      - If you are still having issues after running the .BAT file, please join our <strong>Discord Server </strong>
        so we can provided additional assistance.
  - question: My Files Are Not Being Imported!
    link: import-issues
    answer:
      - There are a number of possible reasons why you're files are not being imported. First, double-check your import
        folder settings and make sure youâ€™ve selected the correct options that reflects your setup. If everything looks
        correct and running the <strong>Run Import</strong> action still fails to properly import your files then what's
        likely happening is one of two things. The files have been imported but the crc32 value does not match any files
        on AniDB or there were errors during the hashing process and Shoko server was unable to get the hash and compare it.
      - Using <strong>Shoko Desktop</strong>, navigate to <strong>Utilities &gt; Unrecognized Files</strong> and if your
        files are showing up there, you can manually link them to the correct episode. if Shoko server was unable to get the
        hash, make sure no other program is accessing the files in question and try again by clicking <strong>Run Import</strong>.
  - question: What Cloud Hosting Providers Are Supported?
    link: cloud
    answer:
      - Shoko currently supports the following Cloud hosts. If your cloud host is not listed below you can always request
        support for it by creating an issue on github.
      - <ul><li>Amazon Cloud Drive</li><li>Google Drive</li><li>One Drive</li></ul>
  - question: Can I Mix & Match Providers?
    link: mix-providers
    answer:
      - At this time, you are <strong>unable to mix and match different providers</strong>.
      - Each provider is treated as it's own set which means its not possible to use a drop source from your local provider
        with a drop destination from a cloud provider.
  - question: Can I Change My Drop Destination?
    link: change-drop-destination
    answer: >
      Yes, you are able to change your <strong>Drop Destination</strong> as many times as you want to fit your current setup.
      However please note that files located in your <strong>previous Drop Destination</strong> are not automatically moved
      into your <strong>new Drop Destination</strong> so its possible a series may be split and located in multiple folders.
  - question: Why Was Support For MySQL / SQL Server Dropped?
    link: db-support
    answer: >
      Previously, Shoko did support both MySQL and SQL Server as possible database options due to multiple issues such as
      database access times and overall speed that were present when using an SQLite database with a large collection.
      Starting with <strong>Version 3.6</strong>, we've been steadily making improvements to address these issues that the
      benefits once provided by MySQL and SQL Server are now negligible. To that end and to reduce unrelated issues that
      could arise when using MySQL or SQL Server, support for MySQL and SQL Server as a database option has been deprecated
      and the option to select either of them has been removed.
  - question: I Use MySQL / SQL Server, How Do I Update My DB Info?
    link: update-db-info
    answer:
      - Navigate to <strong>C:\ProgramData\ShokoServer</strong> and open the file labeled <strong>settings.json</strong>.
        You'll need to update the DB specific properties depending on what DB you use.
      - <strong>MySQL Settings</strong>
      - <table class = "table table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Property Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr>
        <td>DatabaseType</td><td>MySQL</td></tr><tr><td>MySQL_Hostname</td><td>Default is <strong>localhost</strong>.
        If your MySQL DB is on another computer, use that IP.</td></tr><tr><td>MySQL_SchemaName</td><td>The name you
        gave to the Database.</td></tr><tr><td>MySQL_Username</td><td>Either the MySQL root account or the account you
        created.</td></tr><tr><td>MySQL_Password</td><td>The password you selected.</td></tr></tbody></table>
      - <strong>SQL Server Settings</strong>
      - <table class = "table table-bordered"><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Property Value</th></tr></thead><tbody>
        <tr><td>DatabaseType</td><td>SQLServer</td></tr><tr><td>SQLServer_Hostname</td><td>Default is <strong>localhost</strong>.
        If your SQL Server DB is on another computer, use that IP.</td></tr><tr><td>SQLServer_SchemaName</td>
        <td>The name you gave to the Database.</td></tr><tr><td>SQLServer_Username</td><td>Either the SQLServer root
        account or the account you created.</td></tr><tr><td>SQLServer_Password</td><td>The password you selected.</td>
