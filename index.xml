Is Shoko Server Mandatory? The short answer is Yes.
Shoko Server is the back-end of the entire Shoko suite, which means every single program and plugin provided uses it for accessing and maintaining your anime collection. This makes Shoko Server mandatory and also means Shoko Server must be running to use any of the programs or plugins that connect to it.</description></item><item><title>ShokoMetadata - Windows Installation</title><link>https://docs.shokoanime.com/shokometadata/install_windows/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.shokoanime.com/shokometadata/install_windows/</guid><description>Credits to igloo4#9768 on Discord for the initial write up

By default, all tasks related to maintaining and updating your collection are done automatically. By default, every task runs on a timer, these timers determine how often certain data sets are updated which in most cases, works just fine. However, for various reasons you may need to run one of these tasks manually which is made possible by using an Action. Most actions are comprised of multiple related tasks with the action name relating to the task or tasks it performs.</description></item><item><title>Shoko Server - Linux Setup</title><link>https://docs.shokoanime.com/server/install_linux/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.shokoanime.com/server/install_linux/</guid><description>Is Shoko Server Mandatory?

Keep in mind that just because a file is listed as unrecognized, it does not always mean a record for that series, episode, movie or special does not exist on AniDB. It simply means that that the version or file you have in your collection is not known to AniDB.</description></item><item><title>Shoko Desktop - Windows Setup</title><link>https://docs.shokoanime.com/desktop/install_windows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.shokoanime.com/desktop/install_windows/</guid><description>Do I Need To Install Shoko Desktop? The short answer is Yes.
Shoko Desktop is the front-end that is used to manage the Shoko environment. While the WebUI is progressing, the desktop is still your first and best place to go to to manage Shoko.
Shoko Desktop is also not a standalone system, it requires you to run Shoko Desktop on another (or the same) device. Think of Shoko Desktop as an interface for the magic the server portion does!</description></item><item><title/><link>https://docs.shokoanime.com/index.json</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.shokoanime.com/index.json</guid><description/></item><item><title>Search Shoko Docs</title><link>https://docs.shokoanime.com/search/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.shokoanime.com/search/</guid><description>.gsc-control-cse { background-color: var(--backgroundColor); border-color: var(--backgroundColor); font-family: "Muli", sans-serif; font-weight: 600; letter-spacing: 0.5px; } .gsc-input-box { border: 1px solid var(--borderColor); border-color: var(--borderColor); background: var(--backgroundColor); } .gsc-input { background: var(--backgroundColor) !important; color: var(--fontColor) !important; } .gsc-above-wrapper-area { border-bottom: 1px solid var(--borderColor); padding: 5px 0 5px 0; } .gsc-result-info { color: var(--fontColor); } .gsc-orderby-label { color: var(--fontColor) !important; } .gsc-orderby { color: var(--fontColor); font-weight: 600; } .gsc-selected-option-container { background: var(--backgroundColor); border: 1px solid var(--borderColor); color: var(--fontColor); } .</description></item><item><title>Shoko on Plex Changelog</title><link>https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog/shokoplex/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.shokoanime.com/changelog/shokoplex/</guid><description>The Shoko on Plex Changelog is automatically outputted.
