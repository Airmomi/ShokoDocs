Keep in mind that just because a file is listed as unrecognized, it does not always mean a record for that series, episode, movie or special does not exist on AniDB. It simply means that that the version or file you have in your collection is not known to AniDB.</description></item><item><title>Shoko Desktop - Windows Setup</title><link>https://docs.shokoanime.com/desktop/install_windows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.shokoanime.com/desktop/install_windows/</guid><description>Do I Need To Install Shoko Desktop? The short answer is Yes.
Shoko Desktop is the front-end that is used to manage the Shoko environment. While the WebUI is progressing, the desktop is still your first and best place to go to to manage Shoko.
Shoko Desktop is also not a standalone system, it requires you to run Shoko Desktop on another (or the same) device. Think of Shoko Desktop as an interface for the magic the server portion does!</description></item></channel></rss>
