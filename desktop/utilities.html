					When importing your files to build your collection, any file that Shoko Server is unable to find on AniDB (by
					matching hashes) will be listed in the unrecognized tab. Keep in mind that just because a file is listed as
					unrecognized, it does not always mean a record for that series, episode, movie or special does not exist on
					AniDB. It simply means that that the version or file you have in your collection is not known to AniDB.
				</p>
				<p>There are a various reasons as to why your file ended up in the unrecognized list, they usually all fit into
					one of the following groups.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Unknown Release</li>
					<li>Error When Hashing</li>
					<li>Corrupted File</li>
					<li>Not a Video File</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Itâ€™s important to note that a corrupted file does not mean a broken file, in other words just because a file
					is corrupt it does not mean the file has playback issues. What usually happens is the copy you downloaded has
					slight variations from the official source which results in the CRC32 hash value and hash being different
					which is why the file is unrecognized. If this is the case then <strong>you should not submit your file to
						AniDB </strong> as it will be rejected, instead it needs to be Manually Linked. If the file has never been
					submitted before then there will be nothing to check against which is why the file is unrecognized. You can
					submit the file to AniDB using AVDump2 which will add the file which will benefit all users of Shoko. To
					check, simply navigate to the episode on AniDB to which the file corresponds too and look for an entry form
					the release group you have, if it's there then the file you have is corrupted, if it's not then you can add
					it.</p>

				<p>After selecting the file or files, select the <strong>Series</strong> the files are apart of. If you are
					linking a single episode then select the <strong>Single Episode</strong> option in the box below the series
					box and the <strong>Actual Episode</strong> in the second box. If you have selected multiple unrecognized
					files then select the <strong>Episode Range </strong>option in the first box and input the episode range in
					the input fields. In the event that an entire series is listed in the unrecognized files list, you may have to
					first manually add the series. Click the <strong>New Series</strong> button and follow the steps to manually
					add the series.
