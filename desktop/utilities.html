		<h2>Unrecognized</h2>
		<p>
			In the Unrecognized tab you will find all the files that shoko was not able to recognize automatically.
			This could be due to multiple reasons:
			<ul>
				<li>Unknown release</li>
				<li>Failed Hash</li>
				<li>Not a video file</li>
			</ul>
			A few functions are available to you to manage all the files in Bulk:
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-8">
					<table  class="table table-striped">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th width="20%">Available Actions</th>
								<th>Description</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Refresh
								</td>
								<td>
									The Refresh button will refresh your view, and add any files that might not have been cached to the Desktop Client.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Rescan All
								</td>
								<td>
									Forces ShokoServer to rescan AniDB for your unrecognized files with the current Hash.
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>
									Rehash All
								</td>
								<td>
									Forces ShokoServer to rehash the files, this will be usefull when a hash runs into issues.
								</td>
							</tr>			
							<tr>
								<td>
									Search / Logs
								</td>
								<td>
									Self-explanatory, search the list, or view the log.
								</td>
							</tr>			
						</tbody>
					</table>
					<p>
						When you select an unrecognized file you will receive a few more options besides the Rescan and Rehash as described above (but these will only run for the selected files).<br/>

					To manually link a file to an episode or movie, after selecting the file, select the series you want the file to be connected with, choose the episode number (or range of episodes, Shoko will try to match the number of the episodes in bulk this way), and press Confirm at the top.<br/>
